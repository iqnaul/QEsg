changelog=1.5.0 - 2018/03/03 - Incorrect calculation of the initial water depth (thanks to Thiago Galvao)
 <p>1.4.6 - 2016/11/18 - Improvement and minor bugs:
 - The exported DXF file had ground Elevation duplicated instead of pipe manifold elevation
 - The ezDXF library is now only loaded when needed
 <p>1.4.5 - 2016/09/26 - Improvement and minor bugs:
 - The Export DXF tool now create DXF file that can be imported into Sancad
 - Option to Match Pipe Upper Edge is now available
 - Replaced dxfwrite with the newer ezdxf python library
 - Added maximum speed user parameter
 - Minimum covering error on big diameters
 <p>1.3.3 - 2016/08/18 - Minor bug:
 - When 'Maximum downstream plunge' parameter was set, the logic loop was using minimum slope smaller than possible, ignoring minimum covering even causing negative depth
 <p>1.3.2 - 2016/08/10 - Improvements and minor bugs:
 - Bug not consider Progressive Diameter option on big slopes changes
 - Added option to use full decimal length precision instead Sancad's (0 decimal)
 - Increased 'LENGTH' field precision to 3 decimals
 <p>1.3.1 - 2016/08/09 - Minor bugs:
 - Null Node shapefile creation above Qgis 2.14.5
 <p>1.3.0 - 2016/08/08 - Minor bugs:
 - When 'Maximum downstream plunge' parameter was set, the logic loop was not recalculating the slope on each Diameter increase
 - Also check Duplicated PVM identification when 'Check Polylines' button clicked on Rename Dialog
 - Use the bigger diameter available even without flow capacity and add Warning to the 'OBS' Field
 - Virtual length issue for reaches with CONTR_LADO=0
 <p>1.2.0 - 2016/07/11 - Improvements and minor bug:
 - Added Manhole representation to Profile
 - Added libraries information to this metadata
 - Added prefix to Blocks layer names too on exported DXF
 - Bug: Tiny Unnecessary deepening below interference on elevated slopes
 <p>1.1.0 - 2016/07/02 - Improvements:
 - Added DXF Export option
 <p>1.0.1 - 2016/06/22 - Improvements:
 - Added Examples Menu
 <p>1.0.0 - 2016/06/21 - Initial Release
